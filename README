NOAA data processing scripts and Docker container

Summary
The primary function of this code is to update population-weighted NOAA climate data stored in the BSVE PostgreSQL system and for use with DICE.  For portability and future installation into the BSVE framework, the code is setup as part of a Docker container.  All climate streams are calculated over the entire range of raw data (1979-present) in order to provide historic reference.  For a more detailed explanation of the process from raw NOAA grid data to population-weighted time-series, see the DICE manual. 

Functional Overview
These functions require access to the NOAA ftp site ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis2/gaussian_grid/.  The code first checks for updated files at the ftp site.  It then compiles a list of locations from the *_lut tables in PostgreSQL and updates the daily climate time-series for each location.  These time-series are stored in the table noaa_daily.  The final step is to create climate time series at a cadence that matches the incidence data.  

Example docker container build:
> cd /.../docker-NOAA_proc
> docker build -t NOAA_proc:test .

Manual execution
# start Docker container and open bash shell in container
> docker run -it NOAA_proc:test bash
# change directories within container
root@...:/home/shiny# cd /home/source
# Execute NOAA update code
root@...:/home/ssource# Rscript UpdateNOAA.R
# exit container
root@...:/home/ssource# exit

Crontab
NOAA files at the ftp site are generally updated once a month near the beginning of the month.  However the day of the month will vary substantially at times.  Thus this process is scheduled to run once a week.  Most weeks it will check for updated data and finding none, it will do nothing.



Progress Updates
1/17/2019  Due to BSVE MongoDB outage, this code has not been completely tested in the container environment.  The source R-code has been completely tested in a Desktop (Mac) environment.
